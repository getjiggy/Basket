This is a Simple ERC20 token that allows users to create "Baskets" composed of other ERC20 Tokens. It includes a lottery function that will result in no winner 70% of the time. the other 30% of the time, a winner is randomly chosen! The more units of a Basket a user holds, the higher the chances they have of winning! Randomness is guarenteed by using ChainLinks VRF coordinator. This means that in order to call the lottery (any one can call it, it will only reward users who hold units of the basket) the token contract must be holding 2 link (the chainlink ETH fee). This contract can get pretty gas intensive. The lottery is achieved by adding a users address to an array in proportion with the number of tokens they hold. It is done this way because it is in impossible to iterate over the balance mapping. In this way, the more basket units a user holds, the more likely they are to win the lottery. 

The lottery is funded by the 5% pot fee taken anytime a redemption occurs. Potfees are mapped by compenent address and amount. The lottery is paid back directly in underlying compenents to avoid slippage/price impact of trading. 


WARNING! In case new versions of Link token or chainlink's VRF Coordinator are deployed, and to allow for usage without modification on multiple chains, the hardcoded addresses have been removed. Now each Basket that is deployed will contain a publicly viewable address for both the Link token and VRF coordinator to ensure faith in the token.
